            Sport data always contains a lot of very interesting insights. 
            Having been inspired by Sheldon Cooper we decided to find out what helps professional sport players win. 
            American football is a complex sport and defintely contains many secrets to discover for data scientists. 
            Deeper insight about what is important and what is not will help teams, media, and fans better understand the game, and for coaches to find better strategies.

            As good data scientists we are going to start discovering the data with nice visualizations. 
            Looking at players positions, understanding coach strategies and team statistics will hopefully give us surprising ideas. 
            As a model task we will use our insights to predict how many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff.

                                          – Statistically always punching on fourth down makes no sense. When the Aggies give up the ball on their own 5-yard line the opposing team has a 92% chance of scoring when they put deep from their own territory the other team still has a 77% chance of scoring but since they convert on fourth down 50% of the time the math says they should never punch again
                                          We can decompose it into the following statements:
